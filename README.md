THE ODIN PROJECT: ETCH-A-SKETCH

Etch-A-Sketch (https://christian-ortega.github.io/etch-a-sketch/)

This is a browser implementation of the classic drawing toy Etch-A-Sketch. The focus in this project was to learn about DOM Manipulation and Event Listeners. Through JavaScript, I added functionality to buttons, checkbox inputs, radio inputs, and other HTML elements. In particular, the coloring grid and its functionality is generated entirely through JavaScript and formatted through CSS.
